# HashPhreak

HashPhreak is a security research tool intended only for security research and not for malicious intent. 

HashPhreak follows the premise of many brute forcing dictionary tools like HashCat as well as others. The goal of this project is to have a hash dictionary database that is precompiled with various hash types that will be coupled with an efficient search algorithm to provide a completely web based solution. This removes the need to have a compiled local database or compiling on the fly as this can take a very long time. Below is an image of what the front end will look like once complete.
